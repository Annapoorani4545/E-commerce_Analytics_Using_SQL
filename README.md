- **Production-grade features** like data warehousing, query optimization, and automated data quality checks  
- **300+ lines of SQL** covering DDL, DML, transactions, and advanced analytical queries  

## 🔑 Key Features  
✅ **Core Operations**  
- Database schema design with constraints/relationships  
- CRUD operations with transactions  
- Stored procedures & triggers for inventory management  

✅ **Advanced Analytics**  
- Customer Lifetime Value prediction  
- Time series analysis with 4-week rolling averages  
- Product affinity analysis (market basket)  
- Shipping performance monitoring  

✅ **Optimization**  
- Table partitioning by date  
- Materialized views for heavy reports  
- Strategic indexing for query performance  

✅ **Data Integrity**  
- Automated data validation views  
- Referential integrity constraints  
- Inventory stock alerts system  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL-flavored)  
- Data Warehousing (Star Schema)  
- Query Optimization (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)  
- Pivot Tables (CROSSTAB)  

## 📈 Skills Demonstrated  
- Complex query formulation (CTEs, window functions, recursive queries)  
- Database administration (indexing, partitioning, vacuuming)  
- Business metrics calculation (CLV, retention rates, profit margins)  
- Data visualization preparation (geographic heatmaps, time series)  
- Production data management (SCD Type 2, error handling)  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Execute in any PostgreSQL-compatible database  
2. Explore analytical views like `customer_order_summary`  
3. Run `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` for latest insights
